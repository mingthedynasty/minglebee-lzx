						I designed, developed and maintained a wide range of features focusing on the user interface for four releases of Macromedia Director, an industry leading cross-platform, multimedia development tool. Leading 3 other engineers, I worked with my team to implement the MX user interface which involved a complete overhaul of the existing UI code. I also initiated a close collaboration between myself and a large number of Director users in order to improve and sometimes radically change the application's interface. I was responsible for implementing several features such as MIAW improvements, the 3D model viewer, and locked sprites.  Another job responsibility was debugging code ranging from the event model, user interface framework, and low level drawing code. Director was written with a combination of C and C++.
