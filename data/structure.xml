The amount of data gathered as a result of the research was extensive but difficult to process by the average user. SRI asked Laszlo to develop a completely customizable dashboard front end to their huge database of information."/>

                          text="Users can create compound searches for any sort of information avaiable in the database: people, files, dates, and object relationships. Search results appear in a window on the dashboard.  These windows can then be combined into 'containers' which can be nested infinitely.  The contents of windows can link to any other window, thus allowing the user to create relationships between multiple searches. This flexibility allows the users to build their own 'mini-applications' from custom groupings of functional units. "/>
